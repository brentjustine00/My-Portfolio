# Brent Barbadillo - Portfolio

## About Me
- Name: Brent Barbadillo
- Role: Aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer
- Focus: Building clean, responsive, user-focused web applications with modern frontend and backend tools.

## Project Summary
This repository contains my personal portfolio website. It showcases my profile, skills, selected projects, education, and contact links in a single-page experience with a modern UI and responsive layout.

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- MediaPipe (hands-free gesture interaction)

## How I Built It
- Built as a static frontend application using React + Vite.
- Structured the UI into reusable components (`Hero`, `About`, `Skills`, `Projects`, `Education`, `Contact`, `Footer`).
- Stored project content in local static data files (`src/data/projects.ts`).
- Designed responsive behavior for desktop, tablet, and mobile using Tailwind utility classes.
- Added interaction features including smooth section navigation, animated project previews, and gesture-based controls.
- Optimized assets and verified production output with the build process.
